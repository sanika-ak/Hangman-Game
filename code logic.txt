The program begins by importing the random module to select a random word from a predefined list, WORD_LIST. The chosen word is converted to lowercase, and a list, guessed_word, is initialized with underscores representing each letter of the word. The number of incorrect guesses allowed is determined by the length of HANGMAN_PICS, with each incorrect guess corresponding to a progression in the hangman graphic. The game enters a loop where the player is prompted to input a letter, and the input is validated to ensure it is a single alphabetical character and not previously guessed. If the input is valid, the program checks whether the letter is part of the word. If the guess is correct, the corresponding positions in the guessed_word are updated; if incorrect, the number of attempts decreases, and the hangman graphic progresses. After each guess, the program displays the updated state of the word and the remaining attempts. The loop continues until the word is fully guessed or the player runs out of attempts. If the word is guessed, a success message is shown; otherwise, the correct word is revealed. The game is executed by calling the hangman() function, which is triggered if the script is run directly. This implementation combines basic programming concepts such as input validation, loops, conditionals, and string manipulation to provide an interactive game.
